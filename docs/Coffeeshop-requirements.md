6. Guests wait for the barista to prepare coffee and serve meals on their seats
7. When customers order coffee in the store, the temperature of the coffee needs to be maintained at 70 degrees when it is delivered to the table, which is convenient for the customer to drink. If the customer is taking out, it will need to be increased to 90 degrees when repacking, and the whole is the best The temperature when the coffee is brewed is about 88~98 degrees
8. The coffee provided in the store mainly includes single-serve espresso (Expresso), American (Caffe Americano), latte (Caffe Latte), and cappuccino (Cappuccino)
9. Each drink is divided into small cups (short/8 oz/240ml), medium cups (Tall/12 oz/360ml), large cups (Grande/16 oz/480ml), and extra large cups (Venti/20 oz/600ml). The exception is espresso, only single (1 oz/30ml) and double (2 oz/60ml) are available

15. According to the content of the order, the barista extracts the raw materials needed for the order from the raw material warehouse for preparation
## Purchase raw materials

1. When buying milk, you will need to provide Low-fat Milk or Soy Milk
2. The current configuration of the inventory warehouse can store 20 bottles of 2L soymilk and 50 bottles of 2L milk at a time, as well as 100 bags of Sumatra coffee beans in a 1 kg package, and 200 bags of filter paper (one package contains 100 Sheet of filter paper)
3. When the stock of any raw material is less than 30%, you need to notify the barista and the counter to replenish the stock. You can use SMS or email, and the counter staff is responsible for the actual purchase of the raw materials.
4. Let the barista confirm the status and quantity of the purchased raw materials and put them in the warehouse
5. I hope that there will be a visual presentation page in the future to see the raw material usage status, monthly hot sales rankings, and weekly hot sales rankings
6. Every replenishment of the material will be made up to 100%, and the delivery needs to be completed within 3 days

## Provide customized experience requirements

1. In the case of latte, customers can choose not to foam, normal milk foam, or more milk foam
2. For cappuccino, you can choose dry (Dry/less milk) or wet (Wet/more milk) [ref](https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2016/wet -vs-dry-cappuccino/)
3. At the same time, guests can add Whipped Cream (Whipped Cream) to the cappuccino for an additional 20 yuan
4. When buying latte or cappuccino, customers can choose to use soy milk instead of milk

## Making coffee

1. Every freshly brewed coffee is the way to make Italian coffee, and every espresso is called a shot
2. For every shot of espresso, 20g of coffee beans will be used to extract 30ml of coffee liquid
3. A standard dry cappuccino steamed milk (steamed milk) to milk foam (foam) ratio is 1:2
4. A standard wet cappuccino steamed milk (steamed milk) to milk foam (foam) ratio is 2:1
5. The longer you use the steam stick to charge milk, the more milk froth you can get [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q45zCLnLyuE)
